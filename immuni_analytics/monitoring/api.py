# NOTE: To monitor uploads / OTP request, adding the dummy and province information is important.
#  The currently existing metric "REQUESTS_LATENCY" is not enough, and adding such labels to all
#  requests would be inappropriate, since meaningless for most of them.
#  Dedicated metrics are added instead.
